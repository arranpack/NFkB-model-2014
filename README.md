# NFkB-model-2014
For simulation of the Tsui 2014 NFkB dimer model; PhD work I did in 2023.
Primarily made to generate heatmaps, then stacked bar graphs to accompany certain blocks on the heatmap.
You'll have to run the simulations yourself on a big/fast computer, which will generate around 4.8gb of files.
